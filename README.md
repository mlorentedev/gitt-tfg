# Characterization of CMOS Image Sensors

This work aims to characterize CMOS image sensors. To achieve this, the characterization of a sensor from the Teledyne Anafocus brand will be carried out.

For this purpose, a Python library has been developed for the EMVA 1288 standard, which is a standard from the European Machine Vision Association (EMVA) that defines a method for measuring the characteristics of image sensors.

This project is in spanish.
